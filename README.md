# hw5-workDayScheduler

This homework assignment was to create a work day calendar. This project was created using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Moment.js, and Jquery. I was able to create the calendar itself, and create a time slot for each business hour of the day where you could write in something and save it. This is displayed in the console log. I tried using moment.js to display at the top the current date and time, but I was unable to successfully get it to display/work. I was also supposed to make the different time slots change colors depending on whether that time was past, present, or future, but was unable to do this.
